WebExplorer [606] tackles this by generating challenging information-seeking trajectories and training agents to interleave a search tool and a browse tool over many turns, resulting in improved multi-step retrieval policies on complex benchmarks.</p>\n                        <p>WebSailor [41] likewise focuses on information-seeking under extreme uncertainty: constructing high-uncertainty search tasks and using a two-stage post-training pipeline to instill uncertainty-reducing search strategies for long-horizon web tasks. INFOGENT [652] also performs multi-query search across diverse web sources, enabling comprehensive information retrieval beyond task completion.</p>\n                        <p>For retrieval-augmented generation applications, RaDA [653] explicitly disentangles web-agent planning into Retrieval-augmented Task Decomposition and Retrieval-augmented Action Generation, so that each high-level subgoal and concrete action is conditioned on fresh search results while respecting context limits. In addition, GeAR [264] advances retrieval itself by augmenting a base retriever with graph expansion and an agent framework, enabling multi-hop passage retrieval along graph-structured evidence chains. Finally, WebMcAgent [654] exemplifies retrieval-augmented generation for web agents by retrieving past trajectories and external knowledge into a multi-modal RAG policy.</p>\n                        <p>Several GUI agents use retrieval capability to inject external experience or knowledge at inference time. Synapse [655] maintains an exemplar memory of abstracted trajectories and, for each new task, retrieves similar past trajectories as in-context plans, substantially improving multi-step decision-making. Learn-Act [656] builds a three-agent pipeline that mines human demonstrations into a knowledge store and retrieves the most relevant instructions to guide mobile GUI execution on unseen and diverse tasks.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Web Search Strategies</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Retrieval Patterns</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Multi-Turn Search:</strong> Iterative query refinement</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Uncertainty-Guided:</strong> Prioritize high-value information</li>\n                                    <li><strong>RAG Integration:</strong> Ground actions in retrieved context</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Experience Retrieval:</strong> Learn from past trajectories</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
