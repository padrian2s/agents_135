This self-evolving layer equips agents with mechanisms to monitor and revise their own reasoning, retain and reuse intermediate hypotheses and adjust future plans based on external feedback or environmental signals.</p>\n                        <h3>Memory</h3>\n                        <p>ChemAgent [532] implements a self-updating library. It decomposes chemistry problems into sub-tasks and writes reusable <em>skills</em> (ex: procedures, patterns, solutions) that later prompts can retrieve and adapt, stabilizing long multi-step reasoning without re-deriving everything from scratch. On the other hand, MatAgent [533] emphasizes interpretable generation for inorganic materials, where <em>short-term memory</em> recalls recent compositions and feedback, <em>long-term memory</em> preserves successful designs together with their reasoning traces, and both are reused across iterations to guide proposal refinement and enable transparent audit.</p>\n                        <h3>Agentic Feedback and Reflection</h3>\n                        <p><em>Firstly, Scientific Generative Agent</em> [525] ties discrete LLM proposals to inner-loop simulations that optimize continuous parameters, advancing only when evidence improves. The reflection ability is driven by measurable loss reductions. Next, ChemReasoner [534] perform heuristic search over the LLM's idea space but scores and rejects candidates with quantum-chemical feedback, turning electronic-structure signals into a principled critique of linguistic hypotheses.</p>\n                        <p>Complementing these physics-based signals, Curie [509] embeds rigor check directly into control flow via intra-agent checks, inter-agent gates and an experiment-knowledge module. In parallel, LLMatDesign [535] builds explicit self-reflection into materials workflows, prompting the agent to surface and repair inconsistencies before they propagate to tool calls. Moreover, NovelSeek [536] utilizes reflection as a closed loop, updating code and plans with human-interactive feedback after each round.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Self-Evolution Mechanisms</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Key Patterns</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Skill Libraries:</strong> Reusable procedures accumulated over time</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Dual Memory:</strong> Short-term (recent) + Long-term (successful patterns)</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> Simulation results drive hypothesis refinement</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Self-Reflection:</strong> Explicit consistency checking before actions</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
