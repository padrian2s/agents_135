These models rely on scaling test-time computation, improving accuracy by increasing model size or inference budget, but without the ability to interact, remember, or adapt to changing goals.</p>\n                        <p>Agentic reasoning, in contrast, emphasizes <strong>scaling test-time interaction</strong>. Instead of depending solely on internal parameters, agentic systems reason through action: invoking tools, exploring alternatives, updating memory, and integrating feedback.</p>\n                        <div class=\"highlight-box\">\n                            <h4>Table 1: Contrasting LLM reasoning and agentic reasoning</h4>\n                            <table class=\"data-table\">\n                                <tr><th>Dimension</th><th>LLM Reasoning</th><th>Agentic Reasoning</th></tr>\n                                <tr><td>Paradigm</td><td>passive, static input</td><td>interactive, dynamic context</td></tr>\n                                <tr><td>Computation</td><td>single pass, internal</td><td>multi step, with feedback</td></tr>\n                                <tr><td>Statefulness</td><td>context window only</td><td>external memory, state tracking</td></tr>\n                                <tr><td>Learning</td><td>offline pretraining, fixed knowledge</td><td>continual improvement, self evolving</td></tr>\n                                <tr><td>Goal Orientation</td><td>prompt based, reactive</td><td>explicit goal, planning</td></tr>\n                            </table>\n                        </div>\n                        <h3>2.1 Positioning Our Survey</h3>\n                        <p>While several recent surveys have examined LLM reasoning or agent architectures, our work focuses specifically on agentic reasoning as a unified paradigm for understanding reasoning as interaction.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>The Paradigm Shift</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Decision Framework</h5>\n                                <p>Table 1 provides a practical diagnostic: if your application requires ANY of the \"Agentic Reasoning\" characteristics (interactivity, persistence, adaptation, goal-orientation), then pure LLM reasoning will be insufficient.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
