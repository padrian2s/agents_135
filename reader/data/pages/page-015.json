ChatCoT formalizes this paradigm by structuring reasoning traces as alternating \"thought-tool-observation\" steps in natural language, allowing LLMs to reflect on intermediate outputs and dynamically plan the next tool query.</p>\n                        <h3>Optimizing Context for Tool Interaction</h3>\n                        <p>While the foundational interleaved loop is powerful, its performance degrades when agents must handle large or complex toolsets. A significant branch of research addresses this by optimizing the in-context information provided to the agent. GEAR introduces a computationally efficient, training-free algorithm that delegates the tool selection process to a small language model while reserving the more powerful LLM for the final reasoning step.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>The Tool-Use Revolution</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Why This Matters</h5>\n                                <p>Tool use transforms LLMs from \"know-it-alls with hallucinations\" to \"intelligent orchestrators with real capabilities.\" The key insight is that LLMs don't need to do everything—they need to know when and how to delegate to specialized tools.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
