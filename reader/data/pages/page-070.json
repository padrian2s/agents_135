LLM-Coordination [744] examines collaborative reasoning and joint-planning abilities of LLM agents through cooperative gameplay (e.g., Hanabi, Overcooked-AI), measured by holistic scores and fine-grained coordination question accuracy.</p>\n                        <p>AVALONBENCH [745] leverages the social deduction game Avalon to assess role-conditioned language-based reasoning, with datasets of thousands of five-player dialogues and metrics on win-rate, role accuracy, and voting dynamics. Welfare Diplomacy [746] extends the classic game Diplomacy to general-sum welfare negotiation, using 50-game datasets to quantify coalition stability and welfare-oriented strategic reasoning.</p>\n                        <p>MAgIC [747] covers social deduction and classic dilemmas (e.g., Chameleon, Prisoner's Dilemma), employing handcrafted scenario datasets to benchmark reasoning, deception, coordination, and rationality. BattleAgentBench [19] assesses language-based cooperative and competitive dynamics in strategic gameplay environments, scoring navigation accuracy, agent interactions, and exploitability across diverse map datasets.</p>\n                        <h3>7.2. Applications of Agentic Reasoning</h3>\n                        <p>While mechanism-centric benchmarks help isolate individual capabilities, real-world deployments require these capabilities to work together under realistic constraints, such as partial observability, long-horizon dependencies, and safety-critical decisions. We therefore next review application-level benchmarks that evaluate end-to-end agent performance across representative environments, with tasks that jointly stress perception, reasoning, action execution, and coordination.</p>\n                        <h3>7.2.1. Embodied Agents</h3>\n                        <p>Benchmarks under this category evaluate agents that interact with physical or simulated environments, requiring grounding, perception, and action planning. AgentX [750] provides a diverse suite of vision-language embodied tasks in driving and sports, where agents must make decisions using multimedia information from videos.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Application-Level Benchmarks</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Key Requirements</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>End-to-End:</strong> Full pipeline evaluation</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Realistic Constraints:</strong> Partial observability, safety</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Multi-Capability:</strong> Perception + reasoning + action</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
