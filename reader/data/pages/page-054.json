DynamiCare [585] updates multi-agent treatment strategies when newly observed patient state contradicts prior plans. DoctorAgent-RL [584] optimizes questioning policies from consultation rewards; and MedAgentGym [593] enforces correctness by executing and grading generated code. Tool-use pipelines also propagate execution feedback.</p>\n                        <p>Robust reflection mechanisms help agents anticipate failures by monitoring their own reasoning and actions and then adjusting plans. Optimus-1 [307] couples a <em>Knowledge-guided Planner</em> with an <em>Experience-Driven Reflector</em> to revise decisions using stored experience, while another recent study [575] defines structured agentic workflows (including self-Reflection, multi-Agent reflection and LLM Ensemble) that enable robots to reflect on and refine LLM-generated object-centered plans, thus reducing reasoning errors.</p>\n                        <h3>6.3.3. Collective Multi-agent Reasoning</h3>\n                        <p>Multi-agent collaboration enables embodied systems to divide labor and coordinate complex tasks more efficiently, with language often serving as the primary medium for negotiation and role allocation. For instance, SMART-LLM [577] decomposes high-level instructions and allocates sub-tasks across multiple robots, while CaPo [559] optimizes cooperative plans to avoid redundant exploration.</p>\n                        <p>For multi-modal frameworks, EMAC+ [576] integrate vision and language modules and continuously refine plans via visual feedback, COMBO [578] integrates vision and language modules and continuously refine plans via visual feedback, and VIKI-R [552] demonstrates reinforcement learning as a scalable coordination mechanism among embodied agents.</p>\n                        <h3>6.4. Healthcare & Medicine Agents</h3>\n                        <p>Healthcare and medical agents seek to support the full clinical decision pipeline, from initial symptom triage to treatment planning and integrating LLMs with structured patient records, medical ontologies and expert guidelines. Unlike general assistants, these systems must operate under strict safety constraints, multi-modal evidence and legal justification.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Healthcare Agent Requirements</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Critical Considerations</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Must avoid harmful recommendations</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> Decisions grounded in medical knowledge</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Explainability:</strong> Reasoning must be transparent</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Adherence to medical guidelines</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
