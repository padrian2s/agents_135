The memory keeper curates and maintains long-term knowledge structures such as episodic logs, semantic embeddings, retrieval indices, or knowledge graphs.</p>\n                        <p><strong>Communication Facilitator:</strong> Communication overhead can easily undermine MAS efficiency. This role governs protocols for inter-agent exchange, including defining message schemas, managing communication bandwidth, enforcing gating mechanisms, and orchestrating consensus-building.</p>\n                        <h3>5.1.2 Domain-Specific Roles</h3>\n                        <p><strong>Software Engineering:</strong> In software engineering, MAS generally maps onto roles that mirror the software development lifecycle: architects, developers, code reviewers/testers, CI orchestrators, and release managers.</p>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>Architects define system-level design principles and establish structural blueprints</li>\n                            <li>Developers translate these abstractions into concrete implementations</li>\n                            <li>Code reviewers and testers safeguard reliability, checking correctness, maintainability, and functional coverage</li>\n                            <li>CI orchestrators automate builds, testing, and artifact pipelines</li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Mapping to Real Teams</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Software Development Example</h5>\n                                <p>MetaGPT demonstrated that mapping agents to software roles (PM, Architect, Engineer, QA) produces more coherent code than single-agent approaches. The key is clear interfaces between roles.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
