Before discussing adaptation and collaboration, we focus on how an individual agent translates reasoning into structured action through three core components: <strong>planning</strong>, <strong>search</strong>, and <strong>tool use</strong>.</p>\n                        <div class=\"definition-box\">\n                            <h4>Core Components</h4>\n                            <p>In this setting, the agent is not a passive text generator but an autonomous problem solver that formulates plans, explores alternatives through retrieval or environment search, and leverages tools to execute grounded operations. Together, these mechanisms establish the foundation of agentic reasoning, linking abstract deliberation with verifiable action.</p>\n                        </div>\n                        <p>A canonical foundational workflow can be viewed as an iterative cycle that interleaves <strong>planning</strong> (goal decomposition and task formulation), <strong>tool use</strong> (invoking external systems or APIs to act on the world) and <strong>search</strong> (retrieval and exploration for decision support). Reasoning serves as the organizing principle across these stages.</p>\n                        <h3>3.1 Planning Reasoning</h3>\n                        <p>Planning is a central component of intelligent behavior, enabling agents to decompose problems, sequence decisions, and navigate complex environments with foresight. Recent research has increasingly explored planning in the context of large language models (LLMs).</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>The Foundation Triangle</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>How They Work Together</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Planning:</strong> \"What steps do I need to take?\" → Decompose the goal</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Search:</strong> \"What information do I need?\" → Gather context</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Tool Use:</strong> \"How do I execute this?\" → Take action</li>\n                                </ul>\n                                <p>These three components form a continuous loop in agentic systems.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
