This orchestration typically involves planning, sequencing, and managing dependencies across tools.</p>\n                        <h3>Agentic Pipelines for Tool Orchestration</h3>\n                        <p>There are many frameworks designed to enable LLMs to call and orchestrate tools effectively. Most of the current agentic paradigm follows a \"plan before action\" strategy, where the model first generates a structured plan for tool use and then executes it.</p>\n                        <p><strong>ToolPlanner</strong> introduces a two-stage reinforcement learning framework with path planning and feedback, supported by MGToolBench, to bridge the gap between API-heavy training data and real-world user instructions.</p>\n                        <p><strong>Tool-MVR</strong> enhances reliability and reflection through meta-verification of tool calls and exploration-based reflection learning. More recently, <strong>OctoTools</strong> provides a training-free, extensible framework with standardized tool cards, a hierarchical planner, and an executor.</p>\n                        <h3>Tool Representations for Orchestration</h3>\n                        <p>Beyond designing orchestration pipelines, another line of research focuses on optimizing the tools themselves to facilitate more accurate selection, composition, and coordination during orchestration. <strong>ToolExpNet</strong> models tools and their usage experiences as a network that encodes semantic similarity and dependency relations, allowing LLMs to distinguish between similar tools and account for interdependencies during selection.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Orchestration Patterns</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Common Architectures</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Sequential:</strong> Tool A → Tool B → Tool C (simple pipelines)</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Hierarchical:</strong> Planner → Executors → Verifiers (complex workflows)</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Graph-based:</strong> Tools as nodes, dependencies as edges (flexible composition)</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
