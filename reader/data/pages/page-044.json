Traditional benchmark-driven evaluation in these domains is showing clear limitations. Widely used math datasets such as GSM8K, MATH, and AIME are increasingly saturated, which makes it difficult to distinguish among modern high-performing models.</p>\n                        <p>Under the agentic reasoning paradigm, however, both areas are undergoing a substantial shift from static problem solving to dynamic processes that emphasize exploration, adaptation, and collaboration. In mathematics, recent systems demonstrate that agents can engage in competition-level reasoning, building on the success of LLMs in coding tasks. Work in foundational mathematics further shows that agents can search for new problems, propose conjectures, construct auxiliary lemmas, and explore deeper structures in mathematical concepts.</p>\n                        <h3>Large Language Models and Vibe Coding</h3>\n                        <p>Large Language Models have also reshaped coding through the emerging workflow known as <em>agentic coding</em> and <em>vibe coding</em>. In this paradigm, the model acts as an interactive collaborator that engages in multi-turn natural-language dialogue. Users iteratively design and refine programs while the agent maintains context, adapts to evolving requirements, and continuously self-corrects. Modern tools such as Copilot and Cursor have further popularized this collaborative workflow, making interactive programming a common practice in real-world software development.</p>\n                        <h3>6.1.1. Foundational Agentic Reasoning</h3>\n                        <p><strong>Planning.</strong> Explicit planning is widely recognized as a core mechanism for enhancing the structured reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In the domain of mathematical discovery, several systems exhibit structures that can be interpreted as forms of planning.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Vibe Coding Paradigm</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Key Characteristics</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Interactive:</strong> Multi-turn dialogue for iterative refinement</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Context-Aware:</strong> Maintains project context across sessions</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Self-Correcting:</strong> Adapts based on feedback and errors</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Collaborative:</strong> User and AI work together as partners</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
