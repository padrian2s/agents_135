Rather than relying on fixed heuristics for reading and writing memory, recent work has explored agent-controllable memory operations, where the agent explicitly decides what to store, when to retrieve, and how to interact with memory. This reframes memory as a policy target, no longer a passive buffer, but a resource that is actively shaped by reasoning.</p>\n                        <p><strong>MemAgent</strong> formulates memory overwrite as a reinforcement learning problem: the agent is rewarded for preserving information that proves useful and for discarding irrelevant content. Using a newly proposed DAPO algorithm, the model learns to maintain a constant-sized memory across conversations while maximizing future utility.</p>\n                        <p><strong>Memory-R1</strong> further advances this line by introducing a dual-agent design: a Memory Manager that dynamically decides when to add, update, or delete entries in the memory store, and an Answer Agent that distills the most relevant retrieved memories to guide response generation.</p>\n                        <h3>4.3 Evolving Foundational Agentic Capabilities</h3>\n                        <p>Recent advances view planning not as a fixed reasoning routine but as an evolving capability. Instead of relying on static datasets or human-designed curricula, agents can autonomously generate tasks, learn from their own feedback, and adapt strategies through iterative interaction with the environment.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Learning-Based Memory</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>The Future of Memory</h5>\n                                <p>The shift toward learning-based memory control represents a move from \"memory as database\" to \"memory as learnable skill.\" Agents don't just use memory—they learn optimal memory strategies through experience.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
