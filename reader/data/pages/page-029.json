In early systems, search was typically static—built on fixed retrieval heuristics or similarity-based dense retrievers. These methods augmented prompts with retrieved information but lacked adaptive control over how memory evolves or how search strategies are improved over time.</p>\n                        <p>Recent research increasingly links search and memory in a <strong>co-evolutionary loop</strong>: agents continuously update their memory base during task execution, while dynamically adjusting how search is performed over this evolving knowledge.</p>\n                        <h2>5. Collective Multi-agent Reasoning</h2>\n                        <p>Building upon the single-agent foundation, where reasoning supports planning, search, and tool use within a unified perception-action loop, <strong>multi-agent reasoning</strong> extends these principles to collaborative settings. In a multi-agent system (MAS), multiple reasoning agents interact to jointly solve complex tasks.</p>\n                        <div class=\"definition-box\">\n                            <h4>Key Challenges</h4>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li><strong>Role differentiation:</strong> how to design static or adaptive roles that align with task structure</li>\n                                <li><strong>Collaboration and communication:</strong> how agents exchange intermediate reasoning and divide labor efficiently</li>\n                                <li><strong>Collective memory and evolution:</strong> how shared or distributed state supports long-term coordination</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
