Li et al. first showed that equipping LLM agents with explicit belief-state representations in a cooperative text game improves both collaboration performance and accuracy over ToM-free LLM baselines.</p>\n                        <h3>5.2.2 Post-training Collaboration</h3>\n                        <p>In multi-agent systems, the design of agent prompts (or personas) and the interaction topology plays a critical role in determining the system's ability to solve complex tasks. Recently, optimizing these components during the post-training phase has emerged as an important research direction.</p>\n                        <h3>Multi-agent Prompt Optimization</h3>\n                        <p>Prompt optimization in multi-agent systems focuses on how agent roles, workflows, and feedback are encoded in prompts to yield reliable coordination and stronger task performances. For example, AutoAgents extends prompt optimization from single-agent contexts to multi-agent teams, refining role specialization and execution plans through structured dialogue among meta-agents.</p>\n                        <h3>Graph-based Topology Generation</h3>\n                        <p>A large body of work models multi-agent systems (MAS) as graphs where agents are nodes, and inter-agent communication forms edges. Then MAS design becomes a problem of learning the communication/coordination topology.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Optimization Approaches</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Key Methods</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Prompt Optimization:</strong> Learn better role descriptions and instructions</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Topology Learning:</strong> Discover optimal communication patterns</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Policy Learning:</strong> Train agent-specific decision policies</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
