This section surveys representative reasoning-empowered agentic systems across several key domains.</p>\n                        <p>Specifically, each domain exhibits distinctive forms of reasoning, influenced by its data modalities and environmental constraints. Accordingly, our discussion in each subsection is organized around three layers: (1) <strong>core abilities</strong> such as planning, tool use and search that span scientific hypothesis generation, embodied control, medical reasoning, automated experimentation and symbolic problem-solving; (2) <strong>self-evolving abilities</strong> that integrate feedback, reflection and memory modules which refine domain-specific competence through iterative experiment loops, lifelong skill learning and clinical adaptation; and (3) <strong>collective multi-agent reasoning</strong> that enables collaboration and specialization from cooperative scientific assistants to coordinated robotic teams, diagnostic ensembles or multi-aspect experts.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Application Domain Organization</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Three-Layer Framework Applied</h5>\n                                <p>Each application domain is analyzed through the lens of the three reasoning layers, showing how foundational capabilities (planning, tools), self-evolving mechanisms (feedback, memory), and collective reasoning (multi-agent coordination) combine to address domain-specific challenges.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
