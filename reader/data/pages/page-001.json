While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, exemplified by standard benchmarks in mathematics and code, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments.</p>\n                        <p>The emergence of <strong>agentic reasoning</strong> marks a paradigm shift, bridging thought and action by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction.</p>\n                        <p>In this survey, we provide a systematic roadmap by organizing agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li><strong>Foundational agentic reasoning</strong> establishes core single-agent capabilities, including planning, tool use, and search, that operate in stable environments</li>\n                            <li><strong>Self-evolving agentic reasoning</strong> examines how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation in evolving settings</li>\n                            <li><strong>Collective multi-agent reasoning</strong> extends intelligence to collaborative scenarios where multiple agents coordinate roles, share knowledge, and pursue shared goals</li>\n                        </ul>\n                        <div class=\"tags\">\n                            <span class=\"tag\">Agentic AI</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag\">LLM Agent</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag\">Agentic Reasoning</span>\n                            <span class=\"tag\">Self-evolving</span>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Core Thesis</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Summary</h5>\n                                <p>This paper introduces \"agentic reasoning\" as a paradigm shift where LLMs transform from passive text generators into autonomous agents capable of planning, acting, and learning through continuous environmental interaction.</p>\n                            </div>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Real-World Applications</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li>Autonomous AI assistants completing complex multi-step tasks</li>\n                                    <li>Scientific research automation — designing experiments and iterating</li>\n                                    <li>Robotics and embodied AI reasoning about physical interactions</li>\n                                    <li>Healthcare decision support for diagnostic pathways</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
