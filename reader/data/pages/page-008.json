We model the environment as a <strong>Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)</strong> and introduce an internal reasoning variable to expose the \"think-act\" structure of agentic policies.</p>\n                        <div class=\"definition-box\">\n                            <h4>Formal Definition</h4>\n                            <p>We consider the tuple (X, O, A, Z, M, T, Ω, R, γ), where:</p>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li><strong>X</strong> is the latent environment state space (unobservable to the agent)</li>\n                                <li><strong>O</strong> is the observation space (e.g., user queries, API returns)</li>\n                                <li><strong>A</strong> is the external action space (e.g., tool invocation, final answers)</li>\n                                <li><strong>Z</strong> is a reasoning trace space (e.g., latent plans, chain-of-thought)</li>\n                                <li><strong>M</strong> is the agent's internal memory/context space</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </div>\n                        <p>At timestep t, the agent conditions on a history h_t = (o_1, z_1, a_1, ..., a_{t-1}).
