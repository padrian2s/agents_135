Early computer-control systems with structured reflection, for example, a zero-shot desktop control agent with structured self-reflection loops [673], provides conceptual templates that later GUI agents adapt to visual, multi-application settings. GUI-Reflection [674] instantiates this idea end-to-end: it builds a reflection-oriented task suite, automatically synthesizes error scenarios from existing successful trajectories, and adds an online reflection-tuning stage so multi-modal GUI models learn to detect failures, reason about causes, and generate corrective actions without human annotation.</p>\n                        <p>History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) [675] treats long-horizon GUI automation as a reflective learning problem, constructing reflective learning scenarios, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward so the agent acquires episodic reasoning knowledge from its own errors and shifts from history-agnostic to history-aware reasoning.</p>\n                        <h3>6.5.3. Collective Multi-agent Reasoning</h3>\n                        <p>Collective multi-agent reasoning for web agents reframes browser use as cooperation among specialized roles rather than a single monolithic policy. WebPilot [679] models web task execution as a multi-agent system with a global planning agent that decomposes tasks and local MCTS-based executors that solve subtasks, jointly steering search in complex web environments.</p>\n                        <p>INFOGENT [652] organizes web information aggregation into a Navigator, Extractor, and Aggregator, so exploration, evidence extraction, and synthesis are handled by distinct cooperating agents with feedback from the Aggregator to guide future navigation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Multi-Agent Web Patterns</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Role Specialization</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Planner:</strong> Global task decomposition</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Navigator:</strong> Page exploration and traversal</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Extractor:</strong> Information retrieval from pages</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Aggregator:</strong> Evidence synthesis and feedback</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
