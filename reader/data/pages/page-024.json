Rather than merely extending the context window or storing historical inputs, memory is increasingly treated as an integral component of the reasoning loop.</p>\n                        <p>The agent's reasoning process then operates not only on its immediate context but also on this persistent memory, enabling reflection, generalization, and long-term goal tracking.</p>\n                        <h3>4.2.1 Agentic Use of Flat Memory</h3>\n                        <p><strong>Factual Memory:</strong> Traditional memory systems for LLM agents typically treat memory as a passive buffer, mainly used to store dialogue histories or recent observations. Examples include dense retrieval methods in LangChain and LlamaIndex, and cache-inspired designs like MemGPT.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Memory Evolution</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>From Passive to Active</h5>\n                                <p>The shift from \"memory as storage\" to \"memory as reasoning substrate\" is fundamental.
