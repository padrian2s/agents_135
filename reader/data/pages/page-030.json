This role involves setting global objectives, decomposing tasks into manageable subgoals, and assigning them to appropriate agents. The leader arbitrates conflicts that emerge between agents with overlapping or contradictory outputs.</p>\n                        <p><strong>Worker/Executor:</strong> Executors are the operational backbone of MAS. They engage in concrete actions such as invoking external tools, writing or executing code, retrieving documents, or interfacing with the environment.</p>\n                        <p><strong>Critic/Evaluator:</strong> This role centers on quality assurance, verifying correctness, testing hypotheses, red-teaming responses, and surfacing potential risks.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Role Design Principles</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Practical Guidance</h5>\n                                <p>Effective multi-agent systems mirror human organizations: clear responsibilities, communication channels, and accountability.
