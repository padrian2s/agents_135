These approaches expose intermediate reasoning outputs, such as chains of thought or partial solutions, and introduce additional assessment steps that directly influence how the model continues its generation.</p>\n                        <p>Early self-critique and rationale-refinement methods implement reflection through an explicit generate-critique-revise loop. A model first produces an answer together with its reasoning. The same model, or a separately prompted critic role, then analyzes this output to identify logical errors, unsupported assumptions, or missing steps.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Feedback Trade-offs</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>When to Use Each</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Reflective:</strong> Best for complex reasoning tasks where self-correction is valuable</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Parametric:</strong> Best when you have training data and want persistent improvements</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Validator:</strong> Best for tasks with clear success/failure criteria (code, math)</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
