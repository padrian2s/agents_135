Sleep-time Compute enables LLM agents to pre-compute and store anticipated reasoning steps before user interaction, effectively \"thinking offline\" using memory as a preparatory resource.</p>\n                        <p>Dynamic Cheatsheet equips black-box models with external memory to store reusable strategies, reducing redundant reasoning. Other efforts explore complementary paradigms of agentic memory. In parallel, workflow memory has emerged as another structured approach, particularly suited for procedural and tool-augmented tasks.</p>\n                        <h3>4.2.2 Structured Use of Memory</h3>\n                        <p>Graph-based representations provide a flexible substrate for organizing relational knowledge in agents. GraphRAG serves as a foundational technique that augments retrieval with graph-structured reasoning, enabling more contextually coherent and multi-hop information integration.</p>\n                        <p>Building on this foundation, agent systems such as MEMO and Zep organize memory explicitly as dynamic knowledge graphs, allowing agents to store, retrieve, and reason over entities, attributes, and their relations with improved efficiency and semantic grounding.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Memory as Infrastructure</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Practical Implications</h5>\n                                <p>Structured memory (graphs, workflows) enables agents to reason about relationships and procedures that flat memory cannot capture. This is essential for complex, multi-step tasks requiring consistent state tracking.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
