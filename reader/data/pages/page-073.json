General Tool-Use Agents</h3>\n                        <p>This group of benchmarks emphasizes LLM agents' ability to invoke, coordinate, and reason over tools and APIs. GTA [691] presents a realistic tool-use benchmark grounded in user queries and deployed software tools, spanning APIs from image generation to analytics dashboards. NESTFUL [778] evaluates nested API invocation tasks requiring compositional planning across toolchains.</p>\n                        <p>CodeAct [99] simulates executable function calling and evaluates agents on parsing, composition, and runtime accuracy. RestGPT [225] connects LLMs with RESTful APIs via coarse-to-fine planning pipelines, tested on 60+ tool types. Search-o1 [23] frames tool use as sequential retrieval, with benchmarks spanning code search, PDF querying, and scientific tool usage. Agentic RL [779] proposes a reinforcement learning agent with access to tool interfaces and evaluation tasks such as calendar scheduling and translation. ActionReasoningBench [780] benchmarks agents' ability to reason about action side effects and downstream consequences using a structured action grammar.</p>\n                        <h3>8. Open Problems</h3>\n                        <p>In this section, we highlight open problems arising from user-centric personalization, long-horizon interaction and credit assignment, world-model-based reasoning, multi-agent collaboration and training, latent internal reasoning, and the governance of agentic systems operating autonomously in real-world environments.</p>\n                        <h3>8.1. User-centric Agentic Reasoning and Personalization</h3>\n                        <p>User-centric agentic reasoning [782, 783] refers to an agent's ability to tailor its reasoning and actions to a specific individual user by modeling user characteristics, preferences, and interaction history over time. Rather than optimizing a fixed, task-defined objective, a user-centric agent treats the user as part of the environment and continuously adapts its strategy through extended, multi-turn interaction.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Open Research Directions</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Key Challenges</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>User-Centric:</strong> Personalization and adaptation</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Long-Horizon:</strong> Credit assignment across interactions</li>\n                                    <li><strong>World Models:</strong> Internal simulation for reasoning</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Governance:</strong> Safety and autonomy control</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
