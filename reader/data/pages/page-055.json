Foundational Agentic Reasoning</h3>\n                        <p><strong>Planning.</strong> Planning is a core capability for healthcare agents, which enables them to structure long-horizon clinical pathways into diagnostic and treatment phases, refine workflows dynamically as patient conditions evolve and coordinate across teams and tools toward cohesive care delivery. We discuss several various recent advancements as follows.</p>\n                        <p>For instance, a recent agentic clinical system [580] orchestrates specialized tools and guideline citations to support ontology decision-making. EHRAgent [581] decomposes multi-table EHR inference into code-execution steps with feedback learning and PathFinder [365] presents a multi-agent, multi-modal histopathology workflow for diagnostic reasoning.</p>\n                        <p>Other frameworks model planning as an explicit orchestration layer across levels of abstraction. For example, MedAgent-Pro [368] proposes a hierarchical workflow which first generates disease-level diagnostic plans from guideline criteria and then dispatches tool-agent modules for execution. MedOrch [582] treats tool invocation itself as a planning primitive across modalities, orchestrating reasoning agents for multi-step diagnostic execution. On the other hand, ClinicalAgent [583] coordinates multi-agent workflows for clinical planning, leveraging LLM reasoning to allocate tools and synthesize evidence.</p>\n                        <p>In addition, planning in healthcare agents is increasingly adaptive, responding to new information and evolving contexts. For example, DoctorAgent-RL [584] models clinical consultation as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty, optimizing questioning strategies and diagnostic paths via reinforcement learning; while DynamiCare [585] adjusts specialist-agent teams across multi-round interactions as new patient information emerges.</p>\n                        <h3>Tool-use</h3>\n                        <p>Tool integration significantly expands a healthcare agent's action space, enabling precise calculations, medical image interpretation and access to specialized databases. Recent studies are summarized as follows.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Healthcare Planning Patterns</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Planning Approaches</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Hierarchical:</strong> Disease-level to tool-level decomposition</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Adaptive:</strong> Dynamic adjustment based on new information</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Guideline-Driven:</strong> Plans anchored in clinical guidelines</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Multi-Agent:</strong> Coordinated specialist workflows</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
