MedOrch [582] introduces a modular architecture that allows new diagnostic APIs to be incorporated without retraining, while TxAgent [514] integrates over two hundreds pharmacological tools to support therapeutic decision-making across drug-disease-treatment relationships. AgentMD [515] similarly curates and leverages over two thousands executable clinical calculators to learn risk-prediction pipelines.</p>\n                        <p>Other approaches focus on structured function calling for safe execution. For example, LLM-based agents can reliably invoke bedside calculators when provided with explicit function signatures, ensuring arithmetic correctness in dosing and risk scoring [586]. MeNTi [587] goes further by enabling nested tool calls across multi-step medical calculators. Complementing these text-based integrations, OSCAR [617], OS-ATLAS [617] and Ufron [619] further emphasize robust cross-application planning: OS-ATLAS offers a platform-agnostic action model for consistent control, OSCAR maintains state-aware plans that adapt as execution unfolds and Ufron unifies offline and online planning within a single general-purpose GUI agent.</p>\n                        <h3>6.4.2. Self-evolving Agentic Reasoning</h3>\n                        <p>Self-evolving capabilities enable healthcare agents to maintain longitudinal clinical coherence. Representative use cases include accumulating relevant medical context across encounters, updating beliefs as new evidence arrives and revising decisions when inconsistencies surface.</p>\n                        <h3>Memory</h3>\n                        <p>Persistent memory is essential for tracking medical or patient history and maintaining context across interactions. For instance, epidemic-modeling agents [598] maintain temporal contact histories to trace infection chains over time; while MedAgentSim [595] stores experience histories and refine diagnostic strategies over time. In structured data settings, EHRAgent [581] records intermediate computations over tabular EHRs so subsequent steps can reference prior results.</p>\n                        <p>EvoPatient [599] interleaves memory with coevolution maintains evolving clinical state across dialogue phases while AIPatient [594] persists longitudinal EHR-derived variables to drive consistent responses. Multi-agent systems such as MedOrch [582] contain clinical knowledge graph agent which can be considered as external memory that can be queried to retrieve known relationships or diagnostic patterns.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Healthcare Tool Integration</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Tool Categories</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Clinical Calculators:</strong> Risk scores, dosing formulas</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Diagnostic APIs:</strong> Image analysis, lab interpretation</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Knowledge Graphs:</strong> Drug interactions, disease relationships</li>\n                                    <li><strong>EHR Systems:</strong> Patient record access and updates</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
