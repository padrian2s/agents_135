At the core of this evolution lie two fundamental mechanisms: <strong>feedback</strong> and <strong>memory</strong>.</p>\n                        <div class=\"definition-box\">\n                            <h4>Key Mechanisms</h4>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Provides evaluative signals for self-correction and refinement, allowing the agent to revise its reasoning strategies based on outcomes or environmental responses</li>\n                                <li><strong>Memory:</strong> Acts as a persistent substrate for storing, organizing, and synthesizing past interactions, enabling knowledge accumulation and reuse across tasks</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </div>\n                        <p>Together, these mechanisms transform reasoning from a static process into a dynamic, adaptive loop capable of continual improvement.</p>\n                        <h3>4.1 Agentic Feedback Mechanisms</h3>\n                        <p>Agentic feedback mechanisms enable models to iteratively refine their reasoning and actions rather than relying on one-shot responses. By incorporating self-critique, verifier guidance, or validator-based resampling, these methods emulate human trial-and-error learning and form the foundation for autonomous self-improvement.</p>\n                        <p>Broadly, they operate through three distinct feedback regimes: (1) <strong>reflective feedback</strong>, where models revise their reasoning through self-critique or verification; (2) <strong>parametric adaptation</strong>, where feedback is consolidated into updated model parameters; and (3) <strong>validator-driven feedback</strong>, where binary outcome signals guide resampling without introspection.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>The Learning Loop</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Why Self-Evolution Matters</h5>\n                                <p>Static agents hit a performance ceiling. Self-evolving agents can: (1) learn from mistakes, (2) accumulate knowledge over time, (3) adapt to new domains, and (4) improve without human intervention. This is the path to truly autonomous AI systems.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
