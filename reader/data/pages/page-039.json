Unlike static inference pipelines, this paradigm embeds self-reflection, dynamic planning, memory rewriting, or even localized fine-tuning into the execution loop.</p>\n                        <p>Reflexion allows agents to store distilled reflective feedback for immediate behavior improvement, while AdaPlanner dynamically revises and replans mid-trajectory based on environmental mismatch detection.</p>\n                        <h3>Inter-test-time Evolution</h3>\n                        <p>Inter-test-time evolution extends the self-improving process to across-task learning, where adaptations made in one task can be consolidated and transferred to future tasks. This enables the accumulation of persistent, generalizable capabilities over a lifelong interaction stream.</p>\n                        <p>A prominent paradigm involves offline self-distillation, where the agent generates responses and then refines them via self-evaluation before using them for supervised fine-tuning-such-as in SELF, STaR, and Quest-STaR. These methods turn incorrect initial reasoning into high-quality labeled data for future performance gains.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>When to Evolve</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Practical Trade-offs</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Intra-test:</strong> Immediate adaptation, higher compute cost per task</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Inter-test:</strong> Persistent learning, requires offline processing</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Hybrid:</strong> Best of both—adapt now, consolidate later</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
