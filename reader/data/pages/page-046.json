Search is a recurring mechanism in mathematical discovery. Program-search based systems [30] treat mathematical discovery as navigating a program space in which candidate programs encode conjectures or structural hypotheses, with iterative filtering based on symbolic or numerical checks.</p>\n                        <p>Generative modelling approaches [475] explore families of mathematical objects by sampling from flexible distributions that capture structural regularities. Geometric systems such as Trinh et al. [29] and Swirszcz et al. [460] search over constructions, configurations, and high-dimensional polytopes, guided by learned heuristics or structural constraints.</p>\n                        <p>In code generation, repository-level retrieval systems such as RepoHyper [482] locate reusable code segments from large-scale code bases to provide more informative contexts for generation. CodeNew [79] dynamically indexes real repositories during generation, retrieving relevant functions and adjusting based on execution feedback. AUTOPATCH [483] applies retrieval to performance optimization, combining historical code examples with control flow graph analysis for context-aware improvements.</p>\n                        <h3>6.1.2. Self-evolving Agentic Reasoning</h3>\n                        <p><strong>Agentic Feedback and Reflection.</strong> Across mathematical and code reasoning tasks, feedback operates as an external signal that highlights discrepancies, confirms correct inferences, and directs the agent toward more reliable subsequent computations. Feedback mechanisms appear prominently across mathematical discovery systems.</p>\n                        <p>In program-search based discovery [30], executing candidate programs and evaluating their outputs against constraints yields counterexamples or confirmations, enabling iterative refinement of conjectures. In geometry, automated checkers validate constructions and derived relationships [29, 476], providing correctness signals that guide subsequent revisions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Search and Retrieval Strategies</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Code</h5>\n                                <p>Modern code agents combine retrieval with generation to leverage existing codebases. Key techniques include repository-level indexing, dynamic context retrieval during generation, and feedback-driven refinement of retrieved contexts.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
