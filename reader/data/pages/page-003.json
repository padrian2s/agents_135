Agents act by decomposing goals, invoking external tools, and verifying results through executable actions.</p>\n                        <h3>Self-Evolving Agentic Reasoning</h3>\n                        <p>Enables agents to improve continually through cumulative experience. This paradigm extends adaptation to include persistent updates of internal states like memory and policy. Reflection-based frameworks such as Reflexion allow agents to critique and refine their own reasoning processes.</p>\n                        <h3>Collective Multi-Agent Reasoning</h3>\n                        <p>Scales intelligence from isolated solvers to collaborative ecosystems. Multiple agents coordinate to achieve shared goals through explicit role assignment (e.g., manager-worker-critic), communication protocols, and shared memory systems.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>The Three Pillars</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Practical Mapping</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Foundational:</strong> Single-agent task completion (coding assistants, search tools)</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Self-Evolving:</strong> Learning systems that improve over time (personalized AI)</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Collective:</strong> Team-based AI systems (research automation, software development)</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
