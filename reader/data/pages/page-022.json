Unlike reflective feedback, these methods transform feedback signals into supervised or preference-based training objectives that update the model's weights.</p>\n                        <p>Trajectory-level supervised fine-tuning approaches attach feedback to intermediate reasoning traces rather than only final answers. Models first generate multi-step trajectories, which are then reviewed by humans, auxiliary models, or automated verifiers. Incorrect steps are corrected or replaced, and the resulting feedback-enriched trajectories are used as supervised training data.</p>\n                        <h3>4.1.3 Validator-Driven Feedback</h3>\n                        <p>Validator-driven feedback improves model outputs using external success or failure signals, without modifying the model's reasoning process or parameters. A validator, such as a unit test, constraint checker, simulator, or environment signal, evaluates candidate outputs and determines whether they satisfy predefined correctness criteria.</p>\n                        <p>Retry-based systems implement this paradigm by repeatedly sampling candidate outputs until one passes validation. The model generates a complete solution, submits it to the validator, and discards it if validation fails.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Practical Implementation</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Key Insight</h5>\n                                <p>Parametric adaptation offers durability—improvements persist across sessions. But it requires training infrastructure. Validator-driven feedback is simpler to implement but may require many retries for complex tasks.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
