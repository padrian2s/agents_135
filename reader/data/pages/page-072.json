Medical and Clinical Agents</h3>\n                        <p>These benchmarks test agents' abilities to reason with clinical knowledge, patient data, and multimodal biomedical sources. AgentClinic [769] introduces a virtual hospital environment where agents make diagnostic decisions based on patient symptoms and medical imaging. MedAgentBench [770] combines medical QA, patient simulation, and retrieval tasks in a multi-format benchmark grounded in standardized exams.</p>\n                        <p>MedAgentsBench [771] evaluates multi-hop medical reasoning over structured and unstructured data, scoring agents on correctness and evidence alignment. EHRAgent [581] benchmarks agents working over structured electronic health record (EHR) tables and clinical notes to complete tasks like diagnosis code prediction and medication reasoning.</p>\n                        <p>MedBrowseComp [702] focuses on browsing-based medical QA, where agents must retrieve and verify information across web pages. ACC [772] explores trustworthy medical agents with retrieval, hallucination detection, and citation-based support evaluation. MedAgents [601] uses a collaborative multi-agent dialogue setup to simulate patient-doctor-nurse interactions, scoring fluency and factual accuracy. GuardAgent [773] proposes a clinical privacy-safeguard agent with structured risk detection benchmarks on EHR and website forms.</p>\n                        <h3>7.2.5. Web Agents</h3>\n                        <p>Web agents operate in realistic browsing environments and are benchmarked on their ability to parse layouts, execute actions, and handle dynamic content. WebArena [45] introduces a browser-based benchmark suite containing 90+ realistic websites across domains like shopping and booking, where agents complete tasks with structured goals and click-based APIs. VisualWebArena [46] extends this with visual rendering, requiring agents to parse webpage images and align instructions with rendered components.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Domain-Specific Benchmarks</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Key Evaluation Areas</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Medical:</strong> Diagnosis, treatment planning, EHR reasoning</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Clinical:</strong> Patient interaction, evidence retrieval</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Web:</strong> Navigation, action execution, dynamic content</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
