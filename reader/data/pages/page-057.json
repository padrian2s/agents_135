Collective Multi-agent Reasoning</h3>\n                        <p>Multi-agent collaboration is central to healthcare AI, since clinical decision-making often depends on consensus among specialists, negotiation of competing hypotheses and coordination across roles such as physicians, patients and trial designers. In the following, we discuss several strands of research centered around multi-agent capabilities.</p>\n                        <p>For collaborative decision-making, notable frameworks include MDAgents [364], which automatically assigns tailored collaboration structures to teams of LLMs depending on medical task complexity, and DoctorAgent-RL [584], which uses a multi-agent reinforcement-learning framework to optimize multi-turn doctor-patient consultation dialogues. In addition, Agent-derived Multi-Specialist Consultation (AMSC) [600] explores staged multi-specialist dialogues for differential diagnosis that mimics the medical scene of a patient consulting with multiple specialists.</p>\n                        <p>Other notable works include ClinicalAgent [583], which organizes clinical trial workflows via role-based agent collaboration / LLM reasoning and PathFinder [365], which integrates a diverse set of agents that can gather evidence and provide comprehensive diagnoses with natural language explanations.</p>\n                        <p>On the other hand, there are studies focusing on simulation-driven collaboration. These works highlight how multi-agent setups enrich training and evaluation. MedAgentSim [595] co-evolves doctor and patient agents to simulate real-world multi-turn clinical interactions, and EvoPatient [599] uses co-evolution of patient and doctor agents to generate diagnostic dialogue data and therefore gather experience to improve the quality of both questions and answers to enable accurate human doctor training.</p>\n                        <h3>6.5. Autonomous Web Exploration & Research Agents</h3>\n                        <p>Web agents, GUI agents and autonomous research agents constitute three interlinked but distinct trajectories of agentic reasoning systems. Firstly, web agents specialize in navigating online resources, issuing web API calls or browser actions to retrieve dynamic evidence and steer research direction.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Healthcare Multi-Agent Patterns</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Collaboration Types</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Specialist Consultation:</strong> Multiple expert agents confer</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Doctor-Patient Simulation:</strong> Training through dialogue</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Trial Coordination:</strong> Managing clinical workflows</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Differential Diagnosis:</strong> Competing hypothesis evaluation</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
