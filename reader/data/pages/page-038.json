Therefore, recent studies extend self-evolution from single-agent settings including planning, tool-use, and search evolution to <strong>multi-agent co-evolution</strong>, where adaptation emerges across distributed agents.</p>\n                        <p>As a result, multi-agent memory must jointly evolve along architecture, topology, content, and management dimensions, supported by hierarchy-structured, role-aware architectures, governed and distributed storage topologies, modular and task-structured memory contents, and active management mechanisms for compression, verification, and continual updating.</p>\n                        <h3>5.3.1 From Single-Agent Evolution to Multi-Agent Evolution</h3>\n                        <p>While the shift from single-agent evolution to multi-agent co-evolution broadens the spatial dimension of adaptation from an individual model to a collective, the temporal dimension of evolution remains equally crucial. Beyond determining who evolves (a single agent or a population), recent studies also investigate when and how fast agents should adapt during interaction.</p>\n                        <p>We summarize these temporal modes of self-evolving behavior as <strong>intra-test-time evolution</strong> and <strong>inter-test-time evolution</strong>.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Collective Learning</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Evolution Dimensions</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Spatial:</strong> Single agent vs. collective adaptation</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Temporal:</strong> Within-episode vs. across-episode learning</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Content:</strong> What knowledge/skills are evolved</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
