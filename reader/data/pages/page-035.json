Hierarchical systems such as AgentOrchestra, MetaGPT, and SurgRAW feature a central planner or conductor directing subordinate agents through structured subgoals.</p>\n                        <p>Cascading pipelines like CoRAG, MA-RAG, Chain of Agents, and AutoAgents process information sequentially, passing intermediate outputs downstream with limited revision.</p>\n                        <h3>LLM-Driven Pipelines</h3>\n                        <p>This category leverages LLMs as orchestrators that decompose high-level goals into subgoals, route them to role-specialized agents or tools, and iteratively refine workflows based on intermediate feedback until completion.</p>\n                        <p><strong>AutoML-Agent</strong> proposes a full-pipeline, orchestrator-led agent team that plans, assigns, and coordinates web/API/code tools through role-specialized micro-agents. <strong>Magnetic-One</strong> presents a generalizable multi-agent system where a central Orchestrator plans, tracks progress, and performs ledger-based routing over specialized agents.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Pipeline Design</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Implementation Guidance</h5>\n                                <p>Start with manually crafted pipelines for well-understood tasks. Move to LLM-driven orchestration when task requirements are dynamic or when you need to handle novel task types.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
