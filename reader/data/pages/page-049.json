Specifically, rather than following rigid rules, these agents can decide which tool and when to call, how to fill parameters and verify or revise based on evidence. For example, SciAgent [510] formalizes <em>tool-augmented reasoning</em> as a four-step procedure: planning, retrieval, tool-based action and execution. Agents are trained to decide when to call a tool, which one, and how to integrate it into solving scientific tasks.</p>\n                        <p>Through domain-specific tools, ChemCrow [33] chains various expert chemistry tools so intermediate calculations become premises in the next reasoning step, which enables end-to-end planning and autonomous syntheses. CACTUS [511] similarly grounds explanations in cheminformatics outputs, reducing reliance on free-form reasoning by language models alone.</p>\n                        <p>Other notable examples include ChemToolAgent [512] and CheMatAgent [513]. In particular, ChemToolAgent [512] employs a ReAct-like architecture with multiple specialized chemistry tools, allowing the LLM to choose and parameterize tool calls while CheMatAgent [513] pushes further by learning tool use: it integrates over 100 chemistry/materials tools, curates a tool-specific benchmark, and uses Monte Carlo Tree Search with step-level fine-tuning to learn both which tool to pick and how to fill arguments.</p>\n                        <p>For biomedical agents, TxAgent [514] scales therapeutic reasoning across 211 vetted tools and it carries out multi-step reasoning that reconciles drug labels, interactions, and patient context—turning clinical justification into an executable trace. On the other hand, AgentMD [515] builds a two-stage tool memory: it first mines thousands of clinical calculators from literature (i.e. making tools), then selects and applies the right ones at inference (i.e. using tools), pinning predictions to concrete computations.</p>\n                        <h3>Search and Retrieval</h3>\n                        <p>Beyond simple context stuffing, recent scientific agentic systems elevate retrieval into a deliberate reasoning step: agents decide when and what to fetch, and how to use the evidence before committing to a hypothesis. With retrieval ability, BioDiscoveryAgent [527] pulls literature and interim assay results inside a closed loop so the model's next gene-perturbation choices are conditioned on what was read and measured.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Scientific Tool Integration</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Domain-Specific Tools</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Chemistry:</strong> Synthesis planners, property predictors</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Biology:</strong> Protein analysis, gene expression tools</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Medicine:</strong> Clinical calculators, drug interaction checkers</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Structure analyzers, property simulators</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
