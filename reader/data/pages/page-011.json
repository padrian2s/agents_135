Methods like PERIA combine perception, imagination, and action in a unified multimodal workflow.</p>\n                        <h3>Tree Search / Algorithm Simulation</h3>\n                        <p>Tree-based search strategies, especially BFS, DFS, A*, MCTS, and beam search, have become prominent as interpretable and effective planning scaffolds. Several works simulate tree traversal algorithms to mimic deliberative processes. Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) and related MCTS-style approaches treat the agent's code as a hypothesis space, using an LLM as a mutation operator to search for superior reasoning algorithms.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Planning Strategies</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Practical Applications</h5>\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li><strong>Workflow Design:</strong> Best for well-defined, repeatable processes (customer service, data pipelines)</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Tree Search:</strong> Best for exploration and optimization problems (code generation, theorem proving)</li>\n                                    <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> Best for complex, multi-step tasks (research, project planning)</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
