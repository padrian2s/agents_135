For example, SCA enables agents to alternate between generating problems and solving them, reusing successful trajectories for fine-tuning. Self-rewarding frameworks further allow agents to assess their own outputs, producing high-quality training signals without human labels.</p>\n                        <h3>4.3.2 Self-evolving Tool-use</h3>\n                        <p><strong>Creating and Synthesizing Tools:</strong> The culmination of in-context reasoning is the emergent capability of agents to autonomously create new tools. This is achieved not through training, but by prompting a frozen LLM to act as a programmer when it encounters a problem that its existing toolset cannot solve. The LATM framework uses a powerful model as a one-time \"tool maker\" and a cheaper, lightweight model as a frequent \"tool user,\" thus amortizing the cost of creation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Autonomous Improvement</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>The Self-Improvement Loop</h5>\n                                <p>Self-evolving agents represent the path to truly autonomous AI: systems that identify their own weaknesses, generate training data, and improve without human intervention. This is the key to scaling AI capabilities beyond human oversight.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
