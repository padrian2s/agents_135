Several works encode plans as code-like artifacts or PDDL programs. PDDL-based formulations explicitly bridge LLM planning with well-established planning ecosystems.</p>\n                        <h3>Decoupling / Decomposition</h3>\n                        <p>Decoupling strategies aim to modularize complex planning into separable components such as goal recognition, memory retrieval, and plan refinement. Notably, ReWOO explicitly separates observation and reasoning modules to optimize for efficiency. Works like DEPS promote hierarchical thinking through hypertrees.</p>\n                        <h3>External Aid / Tool Use</h3>\n                        <p>Many systems leverage external structures or tools to aid planning, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), knowledge graphs, world models, and general-purpose tool use. RAG-style systems retrieve relevant knowledge to support continual instruction planning. World model-based agents learn or leverage environment models for model-based planning.</p>\n                        <h3>Reward Design / Optimal Control</h3>\n                        <p>Finally, planning as optimization entails designing suitable reward structures and solving for optimal behavior using RL or control-theoretic tools. Reflexion, Reflect-then-Plan, and Rational Decision Agents incorporate utility-based learning to guide planning behavior. Reward modeling appears in works such as those that emphasize reward shaping.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Training vs Prompting</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>When to Use Post-Training</h5>\n                                <p>Post-training is preferred when: (1) you have domain-specific data, (2) you need consistent behavior across many users, (3) prompt engineering isn't achieving required quality, or (4) you want to reduce inference-time compute costs.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
