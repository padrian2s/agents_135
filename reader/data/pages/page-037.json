For example, AgentPrune lists the MAS problem as a spatial-temporal graph sparsification problem, and then applies one-shot magnitude pruning to learn a sparse and effective pipeline.</p>\n                        <h3>Topology Search</h3>\n                        <p>This line of research explores the graph space by searching over agentic operators and communication edges to identify effective pipelines. Specifically, AFlow automates multi-agent workflow design with Monte-Carlo Tree Search over a fixed library of operators. MASS pre-defines some influential graph models, such as debating and tool-using, and then implements topology search inside this pruned model subset.</p>\n                        <h3>Policy-based Topology Generation</h3>\n                        <p>A growing line of research strengthens multi-agent pipeline generation by learning the policy of selecting subsequent agents with advanced training paradigms such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL). These approaches embed auxiliary signals into the optimization process, enabling agents to acquire stronger reasoning skills and more reliable coordination.</p>\n                        <p><strong>MAGRPO</strong> proposes a Dec-POMDP formulation for LLM collaboration and replaces centralized critics with a group-relative advantage signal, enabling decentralized training/execution at dialog-turn granularity.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Learning Communication</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Key Insight</h5>\n                                <p>Rather than hand-designing agent communication patterns, these methods learn optimal topologies from data. This enables adaptation to specific task distributions and can discover non-obvious collaboration patterns.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>"
