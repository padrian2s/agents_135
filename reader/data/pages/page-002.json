Empirically, techniques that explicitate intermediate reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting, decomposition, and program-aided solving, have significantly bolstered inference performance.</p>\n                        <p>Yet, these approaches often assume static contexts and short-horizon reasoning. Conventional LLMs lack mechanisms to act, adapt, or improve in open-ended environments where information evolves over time.</p>\n                        <p>In this survey, we systematize this evolution under the framework of <em>Agentic Reasoning</em>: rather than passively generating sequences, LLMs are reframed as autonomous reasoning agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction with their environment.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"analysis-section\">\n                        <h3>Analysis & Explanation</h3>\n                        <div class=\"analysis-block\">\n                            <h4>Framework Architecture</h4>\n                            <div class=\"analysis-item\">\n                                <h5>Key Insight</h5>\n                                <p>Figure 1 presents the complete architectural overview showing how user tasks flow through the system and how the three main layers interact and build upon each other.
